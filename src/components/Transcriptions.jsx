      <h3>Australian Tune</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve added a transcription of another of my compositions – a short tune
        in 6/8 time which floats between G major and D major tonalities. It’s
        called Australian Tune as it was written while I was backpacking in
        Australia several years ago. It’s in an open Gmaj7 tuning – low to high
        it’s DGDF#BD. You can find a video of me playing it here. I hope you
        enjoy the melody and have fun exploring some of the chord shapes, let me
        know how you get on. You can find more transcriptions below.

      <h3>No Time Like The Past</h3>
      <p>
        Below is a transcription I made of one of my solo acoustic guitar
        compositions – it’s a pretty little tune with some tapped harmonics and
        palm muted bass string work to add interest to the texture. You can
        watch an old video of me playing this here. I’m hoping to add a few more
        of these transcriptions as soon as time allows. Hope you enjoy this one!
